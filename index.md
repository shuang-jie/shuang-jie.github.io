Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher associate at [Texas A&M University](https://stat.tamu.edu/) working with [Yang Ni](https://nystat.github.io/yni/) and [Bani K. Mallick](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/bani-k-mallick/bio). Before this, I received Ph.D. in Statistics at [University of California Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) in 2024, supervised by [Juhee Lee](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/juheelee/home?authuser=0). Before joining UCSC, I completed my Master degree in Statistical Science at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu). I’m currently working on

- Bayesian high-dimensional modeling
- Causal Discovery
- Bayesian nonparametric modeling
- Application to biological data

## MISC
My free time is mostly split among restful swimming, watching tennis (fan of Novak Djokovic), and playing chess. I played chess since I was 6, and obtained level of Candidate Master before 10. I regularly play chess online to have a mind 'spa'. I also like traveling, and some great landscapes are [here](./another-page.html).
