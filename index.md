Welcome! I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://stat.utexas.edu/), working with [Dr. Yang Ni](https://nystat.github.io/yni/).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate at [Texas A&M University](https://stat.tamu.edu/) with [Dr. Yang Ni](https://nystat.github.io/yni/) and [Dr. Bani K. Mallick](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/bani-k-mallick/bio). I received my Ph.D. in Statistical Science from the [University of California Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/statistics/) in 2024, advised by [Dr. Juhee Lee](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/juheelee/home). I earned my M.S. in Statistical Science from [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/) and my B.S. in Statistics from the [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://stat.swufe.edu.cn/ENGLISH/About.htm).

My research interests include:
- High-dimensional modeling
- Causal Discovery
- Bayesian nonparametrics
- Applications to high-throughput sequencing data

## MISC
My free time is mostly split among restful swimming, watching tennis (fan of Novak Djokovic), and playing chess. I played chess since I was 6, and obtained level of Candidate Master before 10. I regularly play chess online to have a mind 'spa'. I also like traveling, and some great landscapes are [here](./another-page.html).
